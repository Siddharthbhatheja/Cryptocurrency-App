A cryptocurrency app designed using the Clean Architecture/MVVM approach and the UI implemented entirely with Jetpack Compose. Two external APIs are consumed using Retrofit, one for displaying a list of coins and the other providing details about a specific coin. Dependency Injection is implemented using Dagger-Hilt, and separate Use Cases are defined for each feature.
